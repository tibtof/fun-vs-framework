# Own your design: functional principles vs the framework

Demo project to showcase the refactoring of a Spring Boot application from a layered architecture to a hexagonal architecture. The _main_ branch contains the refactored solution. There are also individual branches for each architectural approach: [layered](https://github.com/tibtof/fun-vs-framework/tree/layered) and [hexagonal](https://github.com/tibtof/fun-vs-framework/tree/hexagonal), with a [PR that highlights the changes](https://github.com/tibtof/fun-vs-framework/pull/2).

To better understand the context I recomend [watching my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqNDeq-DrVM) and going over the slides.
